								<h2 class="major">About Kelly</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Carousel.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Kelly’s love and respect for young people began at a young age. She started tutoring in high school, working with students from five to fourteen years old on a variety of academic subjects. Starting from the age of 15, she worked as a summer teacher and tutor for a number of schools in Oregon and California.</p> 

									<p>Fast forward to today, Kelly has been working professionally in the field of education for over twenty years. She has been a teacher and tutor for students K-12 in a number of academic fields, specializing in reading and writing skills, and life skills. In the past ten years, she has added a focus on working with pre-K, teaching reading and music.</p>
									
									<p></p>Her students and their parents have described Kelly as having a “magic effect” when it comes to building confidence, learning and life skills. Her approach is caring, patient and effective, so that students build confidence and ability in the subjects they struggle with or in which they simply want to excel.</p>
									
									<p>For students who have trouble with their focus, attitude or behavior in school or at home, Kelly’s decades of experience in resolving these issues for young people and their families has been successful time and time again. Her results speak for themselves.
									</p>
								<p>More than anything, Kelly loves to help people learn and become who they truly want to be.</p>
